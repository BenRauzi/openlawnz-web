We want to make it easier for all New Zealanders to understand law.\r</p>\n\n<p>You can use our search to find case law, and navigate between related information. You can also use our plugins (or write your own) to aid your research.\r</p>\n\n<p>You can use our API to build case law intelligence into your own applications and services. For an example, see our <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/plugins\">chrome extension</a>.\r</p>\n\n<h2>Our data\r</h2>\n<div class=\"paragraph-with-figure\">\r\n              The data we have currently comprises High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court decisions from present\r\n              day back to approximately 2004 (with some exceptions, for example some suppressed decisions and other\r\n              judgments that have not been published).\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              We developed software that extracts data from cases. We extract structured data, including references to\r\n              other cases in our database, and to any Acts of Parliament (current or repealed). We use that software to\r\n              power our search and API.\n <div class=\"figure-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"interior\">\r\n                  <a class=\"btn\" href=\"#infrastructure\">\r\n                    <img src=\"/assets/openlaw-infrastructure.png\" alt=\"Infrastructure\" title=\"Click to enlarge the image\" />\r\n                  </a>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"infrastructure\" class=\"modal-window\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                  <a href=\"#close\" title=\"Close\" class=\"modal-close\">\r\n                    Close\r\n                  </a>\r\n                  <img src=\"/assets/openlaw-infrastructure.png\" alt=\"Infrastructure\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\n         \n</div>\n\n <h2>Who we are</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              OpenLaw NZ is a registered charity.
