                OpenLaw NZ is an open-source legal data platform. Our goal is to improve the accessibility of case law
                and other legal information in New Zealand. We want to make it easier for all New Zealanders to
                understand law.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use our search to find case law, and navigate between related information. You can also use our
                plugins (or write your own) to aid your research.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use our API to build case law intelligence into your own applications and services. For an
                example, see ourâ€¯chrome extension.
